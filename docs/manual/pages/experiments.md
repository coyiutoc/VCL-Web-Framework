# Experiments

These are the following experiments supported by our framework. The table lists the values for the different identifiers used.

For the Madison's multiple ensemble experiments from December 2018, it is in the repo [here](https://github.com/Wongelawit/Correlation_MultipleEnsemble) - you need to pull the `Numerosity-Task` and `visualSearch` branches independently. (So the experiments are **NOT** on master.)

Look [here](/VCL-Web-Framework/manual/terminology.html#condition-identifiers) to understand what identifiers are.
