# Supported Properties

## Identifiers

Below are all the supported values for each of the four identifiers. 

### Base Experiment

### Trial Structure

### Balancing

### Graph Types

## Subcondition Attributes

Below are each of the attributes used to define a subcondition. For experimental attributes, some attributes 
MUST be defined depending on the experiment. Usually, if you are adding a new condition that uses a pre-existing trial structure, the base subconditions from the trial structure already define all these attributes.

Depending on the graph type of the condition, certain graphical attributes can be customized. They will default 
to a specific value if they are not defined in your new condition.
