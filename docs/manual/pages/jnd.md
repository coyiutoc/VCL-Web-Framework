# >> JND

- **Task**: Discrimination
- **Method**: Forced choice with Staircase
- **Method Properties**: Latin-Square balancing
- **Stimuli Type**: Scatter, ring, or strip plots

The JND experiment essentially presents users with 2 plots, one with a higher correlation than the other. The user then must choose the graph with the higher correlation by pressing the "z" or "m" keys to select the left or right graphs respectively.

## Specifications

**_**Note that all CAPPED variables are constants taken from the excel sheets/data file.**_**

- For a given subcondition, there are at minimum 24 trials and at maximum 52. Once a user has reached the 24th trial, we start computing for convergence by calculating an F-value to see if it is lower than the threshold. 
  - If the F-value is < `(1-CONVERGENCE_THRESHOLD)`, then the current subcondition ends, and proceeds to the next subcondition.
  - If the F-value is >= `(1-CONVERGENCE_THRESHOLD)`, then the trials continue.

### Practice Procedure

- We choose 4 subconditions randomly, and let the participant run through those. It otherwise follows the same procedure like the test detailed below.

### Test Procedure
- For a given subcondition's trial:
  - The BASE_CORRELATION for that subcondition will be used to calculate the distribution of one plot, but we need to calculate the adjusted correlation on a trial-by-trial basis.
    - _At the first presentation of a trial_, there is a need to compute the adjusted correlation. 
      - If converging from above, we calculate it by: `Math.min(MAX_CORRELATION, BASE_CORRELATION + INITIAL_DIFFERENCE)`
      - If converging from below, we calculate it by: `Math.max(MAX_CORRELATION, BASE_CORRELATION - INITIAL_DIFFERENCE)`
    - _If this is NOT the first presentation of a trial_, then use the **staircase method** to calculate the adjusted correlation. 
      - If converging from above:
        - If the **previous** trial was correct, adjusted correlation = `Math.max(INITIAL_DIFFERENCE, previous adjusted correlation - MAX_STEP_SIZE)`
        - If the **previous** trial was incorrect, adjusted correlation = `Math.min(MAX_CORRELATION, previous adjusted correlation + MAX_STEP_SIZE * INCORRECT_MULTIPLIER)`
      - If converging from below:
        - If the **previous** trial was correct, adjusted correlation = `Math.min(INITIAL_DIFFERENCE, previous adjusted correlation + MAX_STEP_SIZE)`
        - If the **previous** trial was incorrect, adjusted correlation = `Math.max(MIN_CORRELATION, previous adjusted correlation - MAX_STEP_SIZE * INCORRECT_MULTIPLIER)`
   - Generate a gaussian distribution using the BASE_CORRELATION and adjusted correlation.
   - Plot each distribution onto a separate plot, and randomize whether the right/left plots get the base or adjusted correlation. The manner in which the distribution is plotted varies depending on the type of plot. For example:
       - For a conventional strip, the x coordinate defines the horizontal translation while the y coordinate determines the height of the "strip".
       - For a conventional ring, the x coordinate defines the horizontal translation while the y coordinate determines the radius of the "ring".
   - A user can make keyboard inputs with the "z" or "m" keys. "z" corresponds to the left graph, "m" corresponds to the right graph.

### Trial Logic

Within the trial object, all computations for distributions and constants are performed in the `on_start()` function. This means that prior to a trial executing, we perform ALL operations detailed in this function. This trial object can be found on line 120 in `scripts/experiments/jnd.js`. 

In general, this is what is executed:
```javascript
on_start: function(){

  // Retrieve the constants (i.e variables listed in the section below) for the given subcondition index i
  var constants = get_constants_for_subcondition(i); 
  
  // Calculate adjusted correlation
  // (Refer to next section for pseudocode of this function)
  var adjusted_correlation = calculate_adjusted_correlation(constants);

  // Save all relevant constants of this trial to the JsPsych data object
  handle_data_saving(constants); 

  var base_coordinates = generate_distribution(constants.BASE_CORRELATION, 
                                               constants.ERROR, 
                                               constants.NUM_POINTS, 
                                               constants.NUM_SD, 
                                               constants.MEAN,
                                               constants.SD);

  var adjusted_coordinates = generate_distribution(adjusted_correlation, 
                                               constants.ERROR, 
                                               constants.NUM_POINTS, 
                                               constants.NUM_SD, 
                                               constants.MEAN,
                                               constants.SD);

  // Randomize position of the base/adjusted correlations to be either left/right
  // and keep these positions constant for a given subcondition
  var result = randomize_position(base_coordinates, adjusted_coordinates);
  
  // Set these correlations to the global D3 variables used for plotting
  left_coordinates = result.left;
  right_coordinates = result.right; 

} 
```

### Adjusted Correlation
Below is the pseudocode for how the adjusted correlation value is generated for a given trial. 

```javascript

var MIN_CORRELATION = 0.0;
var MAX_CORRELATION = 1.0;
var INCORRECT_MULTIPLIER = 3;

function calculate_adjusted_correlation(constants){
  
   // If first trial, compute solely using constants:
   if (this_is_the_first_trial()){
      var adjusted_correlation = initialize_adjusted_statistic(constants.CONVERGE_FROM_ABOVE,
                                                               constants.BASE_CORRELATION, 
                                                               constants.INITIAL_DIFFERENCE);
   }
   // If not first trial, data from previous trial is needed:
   else{
     var last_JND_trial = get_data_from_last_trial();

     var adjusted_correlation = get_next_adjusted_statistic(last_JND_trial.correct,
                                                            constants.CONVERGE_FROM_ABOVE,
                                                            last_JND_trial.adjusted_correlation,
                                                            constants.BASE_CORRELATION,
                                                            constants.MAX_STEP_SIZE);
   }
   return adjusted_correlation;
}

function initialize_adjusted_statistic(converge_from_above, base_correlation, initial_difference){

  var adjusted_correlation;

  if (converge_from_above){
    adjusted_correlation = Math.min(MAX_CORRELATION, base_correlation + initial_difference); }
  else{
    adjusted_correlation = Math.max(MIN_CORRELATION, base_correlation - initial_difference);
  };

  return adjusted_correlation;
}

function get_next_adjusted_statistic(correct, converge_from_above, adjusted_quantity, base_correlation, max_step_size){

  var next_adjusted_statistic;

  var initial_difference = base_correlation;

  if (converge_from_above) {
    if (correct) {
      next_adjusted_statistic = Math.max(initial_difference, adjusted_quantity - max_step_size);
    } else {
      next_adjusted_statistic = Math.min(MAX_CORRELATION, adjusted_quantity + max_step_size
                                * INCORRECT_MULTIPLIER);
    }
  } else {
    if (correct) {
      next_adjusted_statistic = Math.min(initial_difference, adjusted_quantity + max_step_size);
    } else {
      next_adjusted_statistic = Math.max(MIN_CORRELATION, adjusted_quantity - max_step_size
                                * INCORRECT_MULTIPLIER);
    }
  }

  return next_adjusted_statistic;
}
```
