# VCL Correlation : Proof of Concept Experiments

This is a Node.js application that runs proof of concept experiments for the following:

- Foundational Stevens
- Foundational JND

## Prerequisites

### (1) Git clone the repository
### (2) Install Node

Visit the following link: [here.](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### (3) Install nodemon [optional]

Nodemon is an npm module that restarts the server every time there is changes to the source code (otherwise we always have to restart our server manually whenever a change is made). 

```npm install nodemon```

## Running the Experiment

Navigate into the folder, then do:

```
node app.js
```

Or alternatively, if you have nodemon:

```
nodemon app.js
```

The app is available at [localhost:8080](localhost:8080). If you want to access it at a different port, change the port number in app.js (line 47).
